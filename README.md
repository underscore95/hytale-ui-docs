# hytale-ui-docs

This project generates docs for Hytale .ui DSL using the Assets folder.

See generated docs [here](https://github.com/underscore95/hytale-ui-docs/blob/main/docs/Index.md)

## Running main.py

You must copy Assets.zip to the root directory and extract it
You must copy Interface from Client/Data/Game

## Disclaimer

I made ChatGPT generate the .md files since it is a pain, main.py is like 90% written by myself.
